# MC-ChatParsing
A recursive algorithm to decode minecraft chat json to section symbols. Also does translations.

# Info
The included file is an example, you only need the parseChat function and the getColor function. If you want to do translations, make sure to have the mappings. You can get them at https://github.com/prismarinejs/minecraft-data.



Happy botting!

(Also if you use this in your bot or just like it maybe consider giving it a star? :D)

#Notes
You can get an updated translations.json from decompiling the minecraft version jar and grabbing assets/minecraft/lang/en_us.json
1.16 chat hex colors do not show up at all in processed text
